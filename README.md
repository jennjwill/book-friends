Book Friends is an app to help you find and meet people who love YOUR favorite books.

1. Add your top-ten favorite books to your list.
2. Get matched with folks who have also chosen some of your favorites.
3. Say hello and connect (if you both choose to do so) via private message. Meet in other social media or in-person.
4. Optionally: list deal-breaker books (if deal-breakers appear on someone's favorite list you won't be matched) to cut down on trolls or other potentially unsafe folks.
5. That's it!

Book Friends was built as my personal capstone project for www.bloc.io web development boot-camp using Node.js, HTML5, CSS (Twitter Bootstrap), Express, Sequelize, Postgres, and Jasmine testing.

It is hosted by Heroku at https://jennjwill-book-friends.herokuapp.com/ .

The idea for Book Friends was not mine. I give credit and thanks to 'the library haunter,' aka @SketchesbyBoze and their twitter followers who interacted with the following original tweet: https://twitter.com/SketchesbyBoze/status/1100196264740864005?s=19.
